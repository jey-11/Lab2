Which methods in your code are called?<br>
The handleRequest method is called. Also in the Server class the main method and the create context method within the method is called. Within the handleRequest method get query is called and so is some methods from the String class.  <br>

What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?<br>
the relevant arguments include the url (port url-seen in the image below with the /add-message?s=Rayna) which is parsed to extract the value of s given(Rayna). The value of relevant fields include count and s. The value of count is currently 2. The value of s is given by the output.<br>

How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.<br>
The count was initially 1 and it was incremented to 2. The new string (Rayna) was also added to the s string.<br>

 Path to the private/public key<br>
 The private key is given by id_rsa. Path to public key is given by id_rsa.pub<br>

 **Part 3** <br>
 Before this class I didn't know anything about the command line or GitHub, I had just very minimally heard about it. These past weeks I learned how to change directories using the terminal, how to create a server and how to add files into a GitHub repository. Surely these skills will be very useful in the future to both showcase and enhance my coding skills.
