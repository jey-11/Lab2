Screenshot 1:<br>
Which methods in your code are called?<br>
The handleRequest method is called.<br>

What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?<br>
the relevant arguments include the url which is parsed to extract the value of s given. The value of relevant fields include count and s. The value of count is currently 2. The value of s is given by the output.<br>

How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.<br>
The count was initially 1 and it was incremented to 2. The new string (Rayna) was also added to the s string.<br>

 Path to the private key<br>
 The private key is given by the first line (the one without _pub added at the end)<br>

 Path to the public key<br> 
 ls - the files within wavelet.. <br>

 Interaction where I didn't have to include my password to sign into the course-specific account.<br>
 ls- also within the wavelet directory<br>

 **Part 3** <br>
 Before this class I didn't know anything about the command line or GitHub, I had just very minimally heard about it. These past weeks I learned how to change directories using the terminal, how to create a server and how to add files into a GitHub repository. Surely these skills will be very useful in the future to both showcase and enhance my coding skills.
